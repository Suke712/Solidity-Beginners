# Creating a Token

Token are basically used to facilitate transactions on blockchain. Here in this project I have created my own token

## Description

In this program I have declared the name of my Token, its abbreviation and total supply of them.
There also are two functions named mint and burn to mint the tokens and burn them. 

### Executing program

We pass a address and the value that represents the amount of the token to mint in the mint function, then we check the total supply, balance of that address if it is equal to the value we passed.
Then for the burn function we pass a address and the value that represents the amount of the token to burn, then we check the total supply, balance of that address to see if their value has been subtracted from the value we passed .
